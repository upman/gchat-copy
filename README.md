# DECOMMISSIONED
Google have added a native "copy link" button to messages and threads now. So this extension is no longer relevant and i have paused developed.

We had a good run. Reaching 100k downloads on the chrome web store! ðŸ¥³

# Google Chat Thread Links & Quote Reply
A chrome extension that adds a button to copy the thread link for every thread on Google Chat.
Adds a button on each message to quote reply to them.
Also hides GitHub Enterprise and Google sign-in previews since they always show up empty in google chat.
